# Geospatial Analysis of Conflict and Natural Resources in Africa  

This project explores how natural resource distribution relates to armed conflicts across Africa. Using geospatial analysis in R, it examines whether proximity to mineral and oil deposits influences where and how conflicts occur.

---

## Overview
- Combines conflict data with geospatial data on mineral industries.  
- Analyzes spatial and temporal trends in conflict frequency and intensity.  
- Maps hotspots of petroleum, gold, diamond, and cobalt extraction linked to violence.

## Methodology
1. Clean and merge geospatial datasets on conflicts and resources.  
2. Map and visualize conflict intensity and resource locations.  
3. Assess spatial correlations and time trends.

## Tools
R with ggplot2, dplyr, sf, leaflet, and raster.
